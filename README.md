##Project 3

This project is realised to obtain an entertaining and funny game called BattleShips. In this game, the player 1 places the ships and shoots in her/his turn against player 2. The one who destroys the other fleet wins the battle.
It can be played with several computers, one for each player, or with one player and the computer as player 2 or with three or four players.
